strings[1] = "A long abandoned laboratory sits nestled in a desolate mountain valley.\nThe frosty wind whistles along the rocky edges and draws you towards a lone shack, glowing in the night.\nYour investigation has brought you here. You push through the snow and cold towards the shack, desperate for answers."
strings[2] = "Inside the shack years of dust collect upon the aged room.\nIn the gloom of the night, you spot fresh footprints leading towards an industrial barrel..."
strings[3] = "A hidden tripwire catches your step as the terrible barrel tips and pours its toxic sludge upon you.\nYou cry out in agony as the slime engulfs your left hand."
strings[4] = "Before you can react, the floor crumbles beneath your feet.\nYou find yourself tumbling into a bright room, hidden beneath the shack."
